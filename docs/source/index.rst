Beautiful Micropython Graphics

Modern micropython-based microcontrollers are surprisingly capable devices:
a Rasperry Pi Pico is comparable to an original Macintosh, Amiga, PC-AT or
other mid-80s computers in terms of memory and storage, although one or two
orders of magnitude faster.  Even allowing for Micropython's speed, a Pico
or similar microcontroller should be capable of the same sorts of things
